# wordlebot

- Make sure you have Python3 installed
- run 'python main.py'
- enter the word given by the bot into the Wordle text box
- enter a 5-number response based on the tile colour. The colour map is given each time. For example:
```
Try this: arose
[0=Grey][1=Green][2=Yellow]: 20001

Try this: plate
[0=Grey][1=Green][2=Yellow]: 02101
```
Here, the letter 'a' from 'arose' was yellow, and the letter 'e' was in the correct position (green).
After entering 'plate', the 'l' was yellow. The 'a' and 'e' were both green.

Keep going until you win!
